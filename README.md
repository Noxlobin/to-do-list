# To-do list
No, this is not a frontend mentor challenge, I actually built this. This is a project that I did in 2016 and I decided to post it in Github some days ago. Hope you enjoy this little project!


Technologies I used:
- HTML
- CSS
  - Media queries
  - Google fonts
- JavaScript
- Local Storage

Any other feedback about this tiny project is accepted!
